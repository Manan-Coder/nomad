Day 2 - 
Did some more research and finalized the build volume of 220x220x250mm as it is neither too massive nor too small, its just the ideal size under which I can print almost every daily object.
Made the inner frame which will form the structure and carry the gantry and rods, the frame is 340x340mm right now (X and Y axes, Z is still to be worked on).
Made hinge, joint models and fixed them their positions.
Total time taken - 4 hours
