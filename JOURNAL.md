Total hours so far - 25 hours

Day 1 - 
Did some research and found the suitable parts for now. Made some rough sketches to visualize the working and stared with cad-ing.
Research + sketching - 3 hours 
Made the aluminum extrusion 2020 model - 2 hours

Day 2 - 
Did some more research and finalized the build volume of 220x220x250mm as it is neither too massive nor too small, its just the ideal size under which I can print almost every daily object.
Made the inner frame which will form the structure and carry the gantry and rods, the frame is 340x340mm right now (X and Y axes, Z is still to be worked on).
Made hinge, joint models and fixed them their positions.
Total time taken - 4 hours

Day 3 - 

Did some more research and finalized the build plate and heat bed of dimensions 235x235x3mm. Found 2020 extrusions, stepper motors, main board, extruder and hotend etc. and prepared a primary BOM.
Time: ~3 hours

Completed the frame design, this took a lot of time as I had to iterate through the design a lot of times, this is because my printer's whole thing depends on the frame. Found a lot of problems in folding it and found even more solutions. For now the base design of the frame is done, minor changes will be there as I iterate through the design more. 
Time: ~9 hours

Completed the y-gantry, bed will ride on it, but the gantry itself will ride a clamp on a telescopic rail. This way it can be pulled out when to be used and pushed in when to be folded. This thing can be folded into a suitcase on paper right now, but god knows.....
Time: ~4 hours
